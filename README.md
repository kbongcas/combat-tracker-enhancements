# Combat Tracker Enhancements

A [FoundryVTT](https://foundryvtt.com/) module that adds enchantments to the combat tracking system.

### Hidden Names

Allows the GM to hide the names of PC and NPCs that are unknown to the players in the combat tracker. Hides the names of NPCs and PCs that are not owned by the player and any other player.
